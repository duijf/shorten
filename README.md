Currently in development. Alpha quality software.

An as simple as possible to manage URL shortner. Project goals:

 - Easy to operate and install -- Just copy our binary to your server or use
   one of our packages.
 - Does not depend on random DBs -- Persistent state is saved to a file.
 - Support authentication before creating shortened URLs.
 - Ability to choose your own URL -- Many available shortners only give you a
   random URL.
